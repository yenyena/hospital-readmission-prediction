# Predicting hospital readmission of diabetes patients

This project was made for an assignment for an MSc module titled Applied Artificial Intelligence. The aim of the assignment was to predict whether a given diabetes patient will be readmitted to the hospital based on the data on their previous stay in the hospital. The project includes extensive pre-processing of the data and experimenting with several models that could be potentially useful for solving the task. I was mindful of selecting well-performing but interpretable models as explainability is critical for a high-stakes application such as in the medical field.
